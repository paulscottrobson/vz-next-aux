======================

www.wikipedia.com/vz200

The VZ200 was release to the world in 1983 by Video Technology in Hong Kong.
it took the world by storm selling over 4 million units within the first 48 hours. (Not true one bit)
But the 1985/6 Dick Smith Electronics catalogue did make mention that "over 300,000 sold". (Close enough)
The unit was sold with a Z80 for its V8-like performance, a Motorola 6847 video chip for the high 
definition resolution with 2 kilobytes of video storage RAM, and, depending on which part of the world 
you live in, either 2, 4, or 6k of normal user RAM. They couldn't make up their minds.
 

The VZ300 was released in 1985 (in Australia at least), and perhaps in 1984 in other parts of the world 
as the Laser 310, such as China, Italy, Euroasia, Germany.

(0) VZ Format
=============

.VZ File format (24 byte header). Created by Brian Murray in 1999.
The .VZ format was put together very quickly one night by Brian to get "something / anything" to work, for the first 
emulator to load and save files. The format is a "snapshot" and not necessarily technically correct by any means.
It was a legitimate hack together format, that, became standard. Those that are VZ purists do not accept this format.
It is not a tape cassette image, and, as is, the VZ snapshot format is not compatible with in any way with what comes 
out of a VZ cassette when played. This format is of the .CVZ format. However, converters are available.
The snapshot format is a very quick, nice, and efficient method to load and save files; as well as they can be easily 
converted into Windows PCM .WAV files that can easily be loaded into real hardware.  22000 hz, 8 bit, mono.

typedef struct vzFile
{
	byte vzmagic[4];
	byte filename[17];
	byte ftype;
	byte start_addrl;
	byte start_addrh;
} VZFILE;





This Issues Feature - The VZ Tape Format
Prior to 1985 the VZ floppy drive was not available in Australia and all File I/O was via the cassette 
tape interface. This article will discuss how the VZ saves data to tape.

VZ Rom routines
The VZ Rom has a tape save routine located at address 34A9h. The routine is coded to save Basic programs, 
however with a small change to the way the routine is called it is easy to save machine code programs or 
custom data files. (See note 1)

Data written to tape is saved in the following order:
    Synch bytes
    Preamble
    Filetype
    Filename
    Start Address
    End Address
    Program bytes
    Checksum
    Trailer

Synch bytes
The synch bytes are written as 255 bytes of 80h. (10000000b) The synch bytes signal the start bit of 
the tape data stream, and help to buffer the signal noise which occurs at the start of each recording.

Preamble
5 bytes of FEh are written to tape following the synch bytes. During loading, The preamble bytes 
confirm the tape is synched correctly, and the tape being read is VZ format.

Filetype
Programs are saved with a default filetype of F0h. The VZ rom uses F0h to identify Basic programs. 
The filetype also tells the interpreter what to do on completion of loading - return control to the 
user for basic programs, or auto execute for m/c programs (F1h)

Filename
The filename is written next - up to 17 bytes, terminated by 00h. The filename is taken from a buffer 
at address 7A9Dh

Start Address
The start address is read from the values at address 78A4/5. For basic programs the start address is 
normally 7AE9h

End address
The end address is read from the values at address 78F9/A.

Program bytes
all bytes between the start and end address inclusive are written as the main data block.

Checksum
During the save operation each program byte is added to a 16 bit checksum at address 7823/4h. This is 
compared with the checksum generated in verify & load operations to check the program was reloaded correctly.

Trailer
A final 20 bytes of 00h is written after the checksum. This is again used to buffer the sharp noise 
caused by the loss of signal, which could potentially corrupt the checksum.

Note 1: saving other program types

The start of the save listing is shown below.

34A9: DI
34AA: LD C,F0h
34AC: CALL 3558h

The first 3 instructions disable interrupts to allow for perfect timing, load the C register with the 
filetype (F0h for basic program), and call the routine at address 3558h which writes the synch bytes, 
preamble, filetype, and filename. To save a machine code program, or any custom data file:

1. Load the start and end address into 78A4/5 & 78F9/A
2. Move the filename (null terminated) into the buffer at 7A9D
3. Disable interrupts
4. Load the C register with your filetype
5. Call 34AC


Loading Programs

To load a program, the VZ does the following:

1. Scans the tape stream for the first synch byte of 80h
2. Waits for first preamble byte
3. Reads 4 more preamble bytes, (if these aren't found a loading error is generated)
4. Reads filetype
5. Reads filename
6. Reads Start Address
7. Reads End Address
8. Reads Each program byte into memory, and adds byte to checksum
9. Reads Checksum
10. Compares tape checksum to generated checksum, generates a loading error if not equal
11. Checks filetype, if F1 jumps to m/c start address

(A) BASIC Programs
------------------
For BASIC programs to be transferred, it is a simple matter of loading them up into the VZ's memory, 
and typing CSAVE"FILENAME", once the recording program is underway.




NO LISTING :
----------
With this you can protect your programs. List command won't work anymore and run will work only
one time after you load program. Be careful as with this it's not possible to break programs running. 

1) load the program you have to protect.
2) insert this line as it is (be sure you haven't line 1 in your program or renum it):
1 poke30884,17:poke30885,123:poke31154,205:run:rem
3) enter this (after each line press -return-):
poke 31467,255 
poke 31468,255
poke 31502,0
poke 31503,0
4) save your program

This was used within the likes of Formula One, and Maze of Argon.


AUTOMATIC LINE NUMBERING
------------------------
This insert the line number in automatic every time return key is pressed. It's useful when 
you write long basic programs as it speeds up your work and prevent errors. What to do:
1) Enter this: (after each line press -return-... 
poke 30946,x 
poke 30947,y (This 2 pokes define from what line number it will start.) 
(For example to start from line 10 digit x=10, y=0) 
(To start from line 1000 digit x=232, y=3) 
(To start from line 256 digit x=256, y=0) 
(To start from line 257 digit x=1, y=1)
2) And this: poke 30948,z (z stands for the incremental number. Next line = previous line + z.) 
poke 30945,255 (Starts automatic line numbering.)


############################################################################################



(B) Binary programs 
-------------------

Binary or 'machine language' programs will need to be loaded into memory and csaved out to tape. 
How do we do this you ask? There are three methods that I know of:
(1) CLOAD the program from tape, or BLOAD the program from disk.

	poke 30884,start address (lo byte):poke 30885,start address (hi byte)
	poke 30969,end address (lo byte):poke 30970,end address (hi byte)
	CSAVE"FILENAME"

Whats that? You don't know the start and end address of your program? Well, Im guessing that if you do a:
PRINT PEEK(30862);PEEK(30863)
This may give the correct lo/hi result. At the time of writing, I havent got the foggiest!. 
Disk drive users may be lucky enough to have a utility or seven floating around such as Extended DOS, 
Extended Basic 2, filesearch, EXT 16, VZ Monitor, VZ Disk Doctor and others that can show you the start 
and end addresses. For cassette users, Im sorry - you may have to ask on the list for help.

(2) Use Binary Copier ("BC"). This will allow you to load in a binary program from cassette, 
then be able to CSAVE it out to tape.

(3) Use VZ Copy Pro v4 ("COPYPRO4"). This utility will load in from either cassette or disk, 
and will allow one to CSAVE the program back out. If you happen to have this program, then use it.
It is possible to grab this file from VZ-Alive web site, convert it to real-VZ format with the use 
of the utility VZ2WAV.EXE (obtained also from either VZ-Alive or Interteks web site), then play it 
out from a PC, into the real-vz. Once it is running, play the file again from the PC, but this time 
the running copy of COPYPRO4 will be reading COPYPRO4 and once in memory, can then be csaved out to 
real cassette or to VZ disk for future use.
VZ Copy Pro v5 ("COPYPRO5") only does disk-to-disk.




Or, in the wise words of Guy Thomason:

poke 30884,sl:poke 30885,sh
poke 30969,el:poke 30970,eh
csave "yamama"
This will dump any memory location to tape. Pretty useful when you want to dump rom images etc.


############################################################################################



(C) Graphics.
-------------

With MODE(0) and MODE(1) graphics, it is possible to CSAVE this memory segment out to tape thru the use of:

MODE(1):
poke 30884,00:poke 30885,112		:rem lo-byte/hi-byte
poke 30969,255:poke 30970,119		
CSAVE"FILENAME"

MODE(0)
poke 30884,00:poke 30885,112		:rem lo-byte/hi-byte
poke 30969,255:poke 30970,113		
CSAVE"FILENAME"


Saving video RAM to Disk:
BSAVE"FILENAME",7000,77FF


############################################################################################



(D) Recording.
--------------

When recording on the PC, select a sample rate of 22050 bits per second, mono channel, 
8 bit resolution. The utility WAV2VZ will only read these "Windows PCM  .WAV" files. 
You should achieve a recording level of around -6 to 0 db. Any lower and errors can and 
will occur, and the utility WAV2VZ will then in turn transfer these into errors in the 
resulting .VZ file. (On my microphone settings under NT, there is a further option to 
enhance the input by 20db. I need this on.)

Once the file has started recording, you then hit enter after the CSAVE"FILENAME" 
command on the VZ. Be patient, and when VZ has finished CSAVEing, stop the recording 
on CoolEdit / Audio Edit / Etc. Save it. Run the utility:

 WAV2VZ FILENAME.WAV FILENAME.VZ

Details of the filename will be shown - start/end/length/file type.  
You should then be able to run an emulator, and load the resulting .VZ file in.

VZEM
====
Guy Thomason hit the world with his first release of a small green screen executable in 
around July 1999. This was the first working VZ emulator. Development through his enthusiasm was quick 
and only within a few months Guy released a full working version of his emulator that would interpret 
the BASIC of a real VZ, and shortly after, VZ DOS. In September 2001 his emulator supported cassette, 
floppy disk and 4 meg of paged memory.

The formatting format of the original DOS/Command-line version of VZEM emulator 
(versions 1 and 2.0), dated 1999, has a slight bug within. The format of the original came out 
as a 98k image, whilst version 2.2 and all subsequent releases of VZEM in all flavours all had 
99k images.  This small fix will change the original release to fix the 98 to 99k problem. 
However, please note, that all of those original 98k images can not be read correctly.

From Guy:
"Disk formatting:
Yeah it seems to work OK now. If you can't wait for the upgraded 
version, change the byte at 1BE73H in VZEM.EXE from A0H to B0H."


The latest release of his emulator (dated around Feb 2021) fixes a few common annoyances that 
have lurked within for a few years. After hundreds of hours of personally testing the product 
alongside real hardware, it is as close as you will ever get. Super High Res Graphics and 1-bit 
audio are absolutely spot on. And in some rare circumstances (1-bit audio), the emulator actually
works better, whereas there is hardware limitations (think 1-bit audio and the VZ's own internal 
piezo speaker) for instance, where the internal speaker refuses to play. Plugging in an external 
amplified speaker to the piezo speaker plays the music perfectly as does the emulator.

During the years, Guy has released a number of flavours of his emulator, on to Raspberry, 
Android, and even a Pocket Pc. Guy will become your best friend should you mention the words 
'beer' and/or 'bacon'. Please do not ever mention the word 'iPhone' to him. 


a) See the VZEM README.TXT file to find all about memory banks, extended audio and extended graphics.


b) Importing 256x192 screens into memory into VZEM.
There’s probably better ways, but this is the developers methods:
I bumbled my way through it by:
- Use irfanview to advance each frame of juggler.avi (24 frames)
- Press Ctrl + F11 to capture each frame to a directory
- Use the irfanview batch convert feature to convert each frame from 320x200 color to 256x192 mono

Once all the frames were converted I used the “Import BMP” feature in vzem to load each bitmap to address 8000h
I did a BSAVE of each bitmap 8000h – 9800h  (6k) spanning two disks
			     c000  - d800  49152 to 55296
FOR I=49152-32767 TO 55296-32767:poke i-16384,peek(i):next
The basic loader program BLOADs each frame from disk, saving each frame to bank memory
To get the animation the program loops through each frame, activates that bank and blits it to the screen
Once I started on it properly the whole thing only took about 3 or 4 hours, was very gratifying to actually see it work!

===============
By: James Tamer
JVZ was written very early in the peace, having been the second VZ emulator released sometime in the 2000-2001 era, 
and unfortunately the initial released copy of it was not ever kept, and has been lost to the ether. 
Version 0.2.0 was released in 2002 with version 0.2.1 being the final release.
geocities died years ago, ocities is the archive of geocities.

(3) MAME (mess).
================
VZ by: Juergen Buchmueller and Dirk Best
MAME is the biggest and largest combination of emulators on this planet. All rolled up into one heck of a single platform.
Juergen Buchmueller and Dirk Best were both members of the VZ Yahoogroups list in the early years, and wrote the VZ emulator 
within MESS/MAME. This emulator is perhaps second in line to being the most 'compatiblest' with a real VZ. 
Disk drive and serial terminal emulation works. 1-bit music emulation is somewhat "ummm"

MAME					http://www.mamedev.org
MESS v0.49b and 0.56 			See VZ_ALL_Software_JAN2021 at www.github.com/bushy555





MESS can be confusing to use, it's the price we have to pay to support a few thousand 
systems and run on many different operating systems.

Some tips:

First time you run MESS, start it with "mess.exe -cc", this creates the mess.ini main 
config file. I like to edit it and disable fullscreen for example.

Some keys:

- ScrLock: Disables or enables full keyboard mode. In full keyboard mode, all
   keys are grabbed and sent to the emulated system (so you can't even exit the
   emulator with ESC). In partial keyboard mode, the UI keys respond as normal.

Starting a system from the command line with the -listmedia switch will
display the files it accepts. For vz300:

d:\workspace\mame>mess64.exe vz300 -listmedia
 SYSTEM      MEDIA NAME (brief)   IMAGE FILE EXTENSIONS SUPPORTED
----------  --------------------  ------------------------------------
vz300        printer     (prin)     .prn
             snapshot    (dump)     .vz
             cassette    (cass)     .wav  .cas

             floppydisk1 (flop1)    .dsk
             floppydisk2 (flop2)    .dsk

So you can use "-dump file.vz" to load it.

(4) JEMU
========
Richard Wilson's name is big within the Amstrad CPC community. He wrote WinApe. Never heard of WinApe? Do a google.
Richard was also a member of the VZ community in the early years whilst he wrote his java emulator. 
Its all there within his site. Load it up, get Java working, and play a game as if you were on a real VZ. Richard lives in Tasmania.

(5) WinVZ300 / DSEVZ200 
=======================
Gavin Turner is a highly active fellow in Christchurch in New Zealand. Loves his emulators. Has written a number of them for differing flavours of hardware over he years.
Originally writing Emulator 2001 with a bunch of things rolled into one, he turned to the humble VZ and decided to write a full blown emulator fully, 100%, in assembler. A tough gig, but managed to do it with his first release (I believ) in 2010.
After many many releases, some of which were not ever saved, his final release came in about 2013 which had its own 1 meg download installer --- which unfortunately to most of us we didnt like, and could not get through to Gavin that this was not a good outcome. Gavin unfortunately arguued the point.   He left our community under bad terms and I though that he had totally disappeared off the planent. Fast forward to 2019 era, and he was a new man. Putting out three more releases that fixed issues and getting rid of the installer. However, there was still some continuuing concerns within the community that a lot of anti-virus software picks up his emulator as being a virus, as had also been done in the earlier years.
Gavin can be found on his 'VZ demo' Facebook page; and unfortunately performing a google search on his emaultor will find many many pages acknowledging his emulator, but most, if not all, go to dead download links.

YuanB's DD20 Floppy drive emulator	https://github.com/yuanb/dd20emu

This project is dedicated to create an Arduino UNO based Laser-200/310 DD20/DI40 Floppy drive 
interface and drive emulator. Since at the moment this project is created, I only have a 
Laser-200 on hand, which has relative less amount of RAM (6K) on board. The design will 
include 16K (6264 SRAM x 2) memory expansion as well.


Jump on to Github.com , search for 'VZ200' or 'VZ300', and keep up to date as each roll out their updates.
Some of these VZ users are quite active.

(H) Video and 6847

-A/G Alphanumerics/Graphics 
(Pin 35) If low you get Alphanumerics or Semigraphics, high gives you Graphics based on GM0, GM1, and GM2 
logic levels. Since the VZ has GM0 and GM2 PCB hardwired low and GM1 high, you get 128x64 Colour Graphics 
Two (CG2). Controlled by bit 3 of the LS174 latch at 6800-6FFF

-A/S Alphanumerics/Semigraphics 
(Pin 34) If -A/G is Lowh and -A/S is also Low, you get the Alphanumerics mode. If -A/G is Low and -A/S is 
High, you get the Semigraphics 4 and 6 modes. Selectable by Video bit 7' so changable per 'character' / 
video memory location. In this semigraphics character, bits 4, 5, & 6 indicate the colour of the character, 
and bits 0, 1, 2, and 3 determine its shape. Each of the 4 least significant bits corresponds to a pixel 
in a 2x2 matrix which occupies the same screen area as a text character. The high nibble 3 bit (D6,D5,D4) 
hex colour code is 0x=Green, 1x=Yellow, 2x=Blue, 3x=Red, 4x=Buff, 5x=Cyan, 6x-Magenta, 7x=Orange.

-Int/Ext Internal/Extranal ROM 
(Pin 31) In Semigrapics mode it selects between SG4 and SG6 Semigraphics mode. Tied low in the VZ, so 
internal MC6847 font ROM or Semigraphics SG4 are used. In Alphanumeric mode it selects an internal or 
external character font ROM. For an external ROM to be used, a 74LS161 counter is used to create the 4 
ExtROM address lines for each of the 12 visible lines per character

Inv Inverse (Pin 32) In Alphanumeric mode it inverts the colour of the Alphanumerics. Also works for external 
character font ROM, but has no effect for any Semigraphics or Graphics mode. Selectable by Video bit 6' so 
changable per Alphanumerics / video memory location.

GM0, GM1, GM2 Graphics Mode 0-2 (Pins 30, 29, 27) No effect when in Alphanumerics or Semigraphics mode but 
allows you select 1 of 8 graphics modes from 64x64 to 256x192 in 2 or 4 colours. Stuck at 128x64 at 4 colours 
in the VZ due to the PCB being wired that way. There are some mods around that disconnect these lines from the 
PCB and control them to get the extra modes, but extra Video RAM is needed (Up to 6k instead of standard 2k) 
which would be controlled by MC6847 Address lines DA11 (pin 20) DA12 (Pin 21)

CSS Colour Set Select (Pin 39) Selects Alphanumeric colours green on a dark green background, or orange on a 
dark orange background. Changes between 2 colour sets in Graphics mode. Can be inverted using the INV signal 
on Video bit 6'. Controlled by bit 4 of the LS174 latch at 6800-6FFF

video timings
=============
PAL VZ200 50Hz sync generation 312 lines per field
PAL VZ300 50Hz sync generation 310 lines per field
50 frames per second = 1 frame every 1/50 second = 1 frame every 0.02 seconds (20 ms)
312 scanlines every 0.02 seconds = one scanline every 0.02/312 seconds = 0.000064 (64 us)
The timings for each scanline is:
front porch 1.8 us
back porch 4.5 us *** horizontal sync ends at the start of the back porch
color burst 2.7 us
left border 7.5 us
display 40 us
right border 7.5 us
TOTAL - 64 us
It takes EXACTLY 228 clock cycles to draw a horizontal scanline. So above in clock cycles is:
front porch 6.4125
back porch 16.03125
color burst 9.61875
left border 26.71875
display 142.5
right border 26.71875
TOTAL - 228 clock cycles

length of one frame is 71136 clock cycles


VZ200 inserts 50 additional blank lines (48 on the VZ300) for each frame, 
half at top and half at bottom. 

MC6847_VBLANK_LINES (13)	/* 13 lines vblank at top of screen */
MC6847_TOP_BORDER_LINES (25)	/* 25 lines top border */
MC6847_DISPLAY_LINES (192)	/* 192 lines visible display area */
MC6847_BOTTOM_BORDER_LINES (26)	/* 26 lines bottom border */
MC6847_VRETRACE_LINES (6)	/* 6 'lines' for vertical retrace */
MC6847_ALL_LINES (262)		/* all of the above */
